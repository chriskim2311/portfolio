                List to Table is a dual interface(client, restaurant) web based application. For the client it utilizes
                google data to display restaurants around your current location along with its popular time historical
                data. Clients can also view: stars, distance, and photos. The application allows for remote check in
                you to hold your spot in line without physically being in the restaurant saving you time. Also on the
                restaurant side, restaurant owners can check the waitlist for their restaurant and notify clients when
                tables become available.
                Our team of 5 wanted to build something useful and solved a problem that many of us had dining at
                restaurants with long waits.
                This was our final project at LearningFuze.
            </p>
            <p>On the front end, I was responsible for creating React components for both interfaces, Google Places
                API, Google Distance Matrix API, </p>
            <p>On the back end, I was responisble with the node.js proxy server requests and setting up the Twilio
                text-message service API</p>

                    <p>During the initial stages, our senior developer producer encouraged us to pursue data first rather than visuals. Our application's bread and butter was the data we could implement, so we spent our first days data mining. Prototyping became a huge part of the project; once we found the data and determined what we needed to do with it, we had scrum meetings to size each prototype in JavaScript. At the time we knew we wanted to use React but we were not incredibly familiar with it. When all is said and done, React is just JavaScript, so we needed to trust the agile process, make sure we could do what we set out to do in plain JavaScript, and the time would come when the pieces would fit together in React.</p>

                    <p>I took on the role of UI/UX designer and delved into user stories and personas. Again, we were setting up the details before putting pen to paper. Because we aren't full-fledged UX researchers, we did research on a budget using our junior developers for feedback. Using brief summaries of what I thought the ideal app flow would be, I then considered different possibilities for failure that would could mitigate once we started building. </p>

                    <img class="img-space" src="assets/images/portfolio/oladaa/persona_detail.png" alt="persona details" />
                    <p>Using <a target="_blank" href="http://userforge.com">UserForge's</a> quick persona creation, I created three users with different activity levels we could test and different pain points to keep in mind. As developers, it's easy to become close to the product and forget who it's really meant to help, so I knew it would be helpful to keep these three in mind over the course of our project. We even included them as mock users to provide different events based on their activity score.</p>
                    <img class="img-space" src="assets/images/portfolio/oladaa/oladaa_wireframes.png" alt="wireframes" />
                    <p>Once we had our basic data prototypes completed and an idea of how the app should flow, we could finally start the visual process. Before touching the computer I sketched out a first concept with various labels and direction, took it to our project manager and juniors for feedback, and iterated on it based on their suggestions. Then I took it to Balsamiq for cleaner, low-fidelity wireframes.</p>
                    <p>From here we could see what sorts of components we would need to make, which ones would have state and which would be static.</p>

                    <p>One of the challenging elements of this project was learning React/Redux on top of Material-UI. But digging in to the framework and library helped solidify my knowledge, though there is still so much to master. We spent a huge part of the project planning and prototyping but by the time it was necessary to share our MVP we had a solid app that came together because of so much preparation.</p> -->
